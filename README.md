-div for form<br>
    -form element to upload the users sneakers<br>
        -header title that says something like "add your sneakers"<br>
        -text input fields, username, brand of shoes, add on features, etc.<br>
        -input for submit button<br>

    -js append div for shoe card,<br>
        -js append img, p elements into shoe card for image and details<br>

user stories:<br>
As a user I can post/upload a photo of my sneaks and describe them in the form fields.<br>
I can scroll through sneakers in the database and 'like' them.<br>
(if there's time/we can figure it out) I can sort through the database in order of likes.
