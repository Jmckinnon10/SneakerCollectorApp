# SneakerCollectorApp
Project pitch:
Sneaker app allows the user to upload a photo/small profile of their sneakers and vote/like on other user's sneakers.

rough wireframe:

FORM:
-div for form
    -form element to upload the users sneakers
        -header title that says something like "add your sneakers"
        -text input fields, username, brand of shoes, add on features, etc.
        -input for submit button

SHOE CARDS:
-div in html that contains all of the shoes in the database
    -js append div for shoe card, 
        -js append img, p elements into shoe card for image and details

-db.json of the shoes

user stories:
As a user I can post/upload a photo of my sneaks and describe them in the form fields.
I can scroll through sneakers in the database and 'like' them.
(if there's time/we can figure it out) I can sort through the database in order of likes.
